----- GRAPH (directed/undirected)-----
--------------------------------------
variation of graph:-
1. weighted
2.unweigthed

Another version of the graph: -
1. directed
2. undirected

* Directed edges
* undirected edges

# Bipartite Graph
#complete graph

# DAG (directed Acyclic Graph)
# Multi edge self loop


========================================
    1. weighted vs unweighted
    2. directed vs undirected
    3. bipartite
    4. complete
    5. Tree
        1. Rooted vs unrooted trees
    6. DAG
========================================

----- TREE (not directed, ) -----
---------------------------------
1. Rooted Tree
2. Unrooted Tree
